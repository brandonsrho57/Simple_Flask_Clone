# Simple Flask Twitter Clone

![twitter_clone.png](twitter clone snapshot)

For CS40, our last project is to create a simple twitter clone using the Flask library in Python (3.8).
The simple web application utilizes several libraries to work in conjunction with Flask including:

* Bootstrap
* Request
* Render_Template
* Send_From_Directory
* Make_Response
* SQLite3

While we focused more on the routes and paths that a web application can have, we also made sure to include log-in and log-out functionality so that it's a more secure environment. 
The password is also hidden when typed, so that's nice as well! 

For SQLite3, we used it to store a log of names and messages that they've sent, which is displayed after being successfully logged in.
